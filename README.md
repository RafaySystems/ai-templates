# AI and Generative AI Templates 
This Git repository **aggregates** multiple Rafay Git repos which host "infrastructure templates" for a variety of use cases for Generative AI, AI and HPC applications. These templates are based on Rafay Environment Manager and/or Kubernetes Manager. Note that additional templates are in active development and expected to launch in the upcoming weeks.
